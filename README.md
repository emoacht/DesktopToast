# Desktop Toast

A library for toast notifications from desktop app. This library will, if necessary, install a shortcut in Windows startup and show a toast asynchronously.

## Requirements

 * .NET Framework 4.5.2
 * Windows 8.0 or newer

## Contents

 - DesktopToast - The library.

 - DesktopToast.Wpf - Sample WPF app to use this library.

 - DesktopToast.WinForms - Sample WinForms app to use this library.

 - DesktopToast.Proxy - Sample console app which acts as proxy to this library. This app will accept a request in JSON format from standard input, transfer the request to this library and return the result to standard output.

### Note

- `Windows` in project references is for using Windows Runtime (WinRT) API. It refers to __Windows.winmd__ whose location has been changed over time. If it is not solved, find its location in your system and modify its path in .csproj file. 

## Usage

Instantiate ToastRequest class, set its properties and then call ToastManager.ShowAsync method.

```csharp
public async Task<bool> ShowToastAsync()
{
    var request = new ToastRequest
    {
        ToastTitle = "DesktopToast WPF Sample",
        ToastBody = "This is a toast test.",
        ToastLogoFilePath = string.Format("file:///{0}", Path.GetFullPath("toast128.png")),
        ShortcutFileName = "DesktopToast.Wpf.lnk",
        ShortcutTargetFilePath = Assembly.GetExecutingAssembly().Location,
        AppId = "DesktopToast.Wpf",
    };

    var result = await ToastManager.ShowAsync(request);

    return (result == ToastResult.Activated);
}
```

## Action Center of Windows 10

To interact with Action Center of Windows 10, an application needs to register COM class type which implements [INotificationActivationCallback][1]. In addition, the registration of COM server in the registry is required for an application to be started by COM when it is not running.

See WPF sample for implementation. Note that the CLSID of COM class type (AppUserModelToastActivatorCLSID) must be unique for each application.

Also check the following sample.

 * [WindowsNotifications/desktop-toasts][2]

## Interactive toast of Windows 10

To show an interactive toast of Windows 10, prepare a XML representation of toast and set it to ToastXml property. Check the following article.

 * [Adaptive and interactive toast notifications for Windows 10][3]

You can compose it from scratch or utilize [NotificationsExtensions.Win10][4] library. See WPF sample.
